      "question": "Why adopt a subscription business model?",
      "answer": "One, it attracts more customers with its lower entry point (e.g., paying $15 monthly vs. $150 in advance). Two, it offers predictable revenue for businesses. Three, it allows businesses to build stronger, more valuable relationships with its customers."

      "question": "How does a subscription management model work?",
      "answer": "Subscription management involves handling the entire customer lifecycle, from initial sign-up and recurring billing to managing upgrades, downgrades, pauses, and cancellations. It often requires specialized software to automate these processes."
